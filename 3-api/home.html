        API stands for Application Programming Interface. 
        In the context of APIs, the word Application refers 
        to any software with a distinct function. Interface 
        can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications.
        APIs allow developers to sync data between multiple platforms and can
        facilitate communication among the various microservices in web applications.
        API integration is what does the work when, for example, you enter 
        a new contact in Salesforce and it auto-populates to Marketo as well.
